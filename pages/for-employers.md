## Dashboard

Employer Dashboard is available at [dashboard.reeljobs.eu](https://dashboard.reeljobs.eu ':ignore')

You will be requested to register an account in order to access Employer Dashboard.

## Drafting adverts

Clicking [`Post a job`](https://dashboard.reeljobs.eu/job-adverts/draft ':ignore') button 
will take you to an advert drafting form. You need to fill out required information about 
the role in order to proceed to publication.

ReelJobs is a video-first job board, so you need to prepare a short reel presenting
the advertised role. While drafting the advert, you can upload a video file (.mp4) to your Dashboard,
use a previously uploaded video, or provide a link to a publicly available video, 
e.g. from your [YouTube](https://youtube.com ':ignore') channel.

## Publishing adverts

Publishing an advert results in:
- making the advert discoverable in our [Job Search](https://reeljobs.eu ':ignore')
- providing you with a permanent public link to the advert, which you can share on social media
- allowing you to track advert statistics (view count, application count)

Before publishing an advert you need to decide how would you like to pay for the publication.
We recommend using one of our subscription plans, although you are also welcome to go with 
a one-time payment if you are not yet ready for a longer-term commitment.

See our [pricing page](https://dashboard.reeljobs.eu/pricing ':ignore') to review the options.

### Subscription plans

We offer a variety of plans, ranging from 5 to 100 adverts slots
- each plan offers a number of advert slots
- you can have as many of simultaneously published adverts as there are slots in the purchased plan
- slots are recyclable - when one of your published adverts is terminated, the slot becomes available again to use for another job advert
- your published adverts stay active as long as you need them - without any additional fees for prolongation
- you can manage the duration and number of published adverts within your available slots

Our plans are offered in two flavors:
- with monthly payments
- with annual payments

> [!TIP]
> By choosing annual payments, you can save 20% - just [compare the prices](https://dashboard.reeljobs.eu/pricing ':ignore')!

You can purchase a subscription by clicking `See pricing` button in `Manage subscription` section 
in [Employer Dashboard](https://dashboard.reeljobs.eu ':ignore')

After selecting the plan that best suits your needs, you will be redirected to a checkout page of our 
[payment processing partner](https://stripe.com ':ignore') and asked for a valid credit card.

Your card will be charged at the beginning of each billing period (monthly or annually - depending on your choice) until you terminate the subscription.

#### Managing your subscription and billing information

Clicking `Manage billing` button in `Manage subscription` section
in [Employer Dashboard](https://dashboard.reeljobs.eu ':ignore') will take you to Billing Portal,
where you can:
- configure your payment methods (adding & removing credit cards)
- configure your billing address for invoicing
- see your invoice history
- upgrade, downgrade or cancel your current subscription plan

> [!NOTE]
> What happens when you cancel your subscription plan?
> - your published adverts will remain active until the end of current billing period 

> [!WARNING]
> What happens when you downgrade your subscription plan?
> - we will reduce the amount charged to your credit card **starting from the next billing period**
> - upon start of the next billing period, if you have more published adverts than slots in your new plan,
>   we will terminate your oldest adverts
>     - we recommend that you manually terminate the superfluous adverts prior to start date of the next billing period


### One-time payments

Yu may choose to publish an advert without purchasing a subscription plan. In such case, 
you will be redirected to a checkout page of a one-time payment for Advert Publication for 30 days.

Upon successful payment, your advert will be published, and will get assigned an expiration date of 30 days since publication.

Expired adverts are automatically terminated.

#### Prolongations

You can prolong an active (not terminated) advert which was published via one-time publication payment.

When doing so, you will be redirected to a checkout page of a one-time payment for Advert Prolongation for 7 days.

Upon successful payment, expiration date of the advert will be extended by 7 days.
 

> [!NOTE]
> Adverts published within a subscription plan do not have an expiration date - they never expire automatically

> [!TIP]
> You can publish adverts with one-time payment even if you do have a subscription plan, but you ran out of slots - and 
> you only need one or two extra adverts.
> 
> If you need more than a few, you should consider upgrading your subscription plan.

## Terminating adverts

Advert can be terminated in few ways:
- manually by yourself, when you decide that the advert is no longer needed (e.g. the role was filled)
- by portal administrators, in case the advert is violating our Terms and Conditions (see [Documents](pages/documents.md))
    - e.g. if the advert is reported as inappropriate content
- automatically, if its expiration date passes
- automatically, as a result of subscription plan cancellation or downgrade (see previous sections)
- automatically, in case of subscription payment failure
    - don't worry, you will first receive a notification about failed payment attempt, and will have plenty of time to fix the payment method
